# About Me

I teach in the undergraduate Computer Science program and the Data Science master's program at New College of Florida.

I joined the faculty of New College in the fall of 2013, and I defined the requirements for the Computer Science Area of Concentration (AOC, or major) that academic year. As of 2017 the department has four regular faculty and 42 students in the AOC.

In the spring of 2014 I helped begin planning the structure and curriculum of the New College Data Science master's program. The program began in January, 2016, and the first cohort of seven students graduated in May, 2017.
