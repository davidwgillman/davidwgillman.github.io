# About Me

I joined the faculty of New College in the fall of 2013 and I created the Computer Science Area of Concentration (AOC, or major) that academic year. As of 2024 the department has five regular faculty and about 60 students in the AOC.

Beginning in the spring of 2014 I helped define the structure and curriculum of the New College Data Science master's program. I taught regularly in the program from 2015 through 2021, and I contribute occasionally now. I organized [LADS 2018](ladsworkshop2018), which took place at New College January 10-11, 2018.

My recent research has been in music information retrieval, discrete structures and mixing rates of Markov chains, and Internet measurement.
