The Sen Conjecture, made in 1994 based on supersymmetric physics, is a statement about *L*<sup>2</sup> harmonic forms on the monopole moduli spaces *M<sub>k</sub>*. The Vafa-Witten Conjecture is a parallel conjecture for the Hilbert schemes *H<sub>k</sub>* of *k* points in *C*<sup>2</sup>, and there are similar questions and answers about the asymptotic behaviour of the moduli space of Higgs bundles. Meanwhile, the study of monopoles has received fresh attention from the physics community: here singular monopoles have an increasingly important role to play and have led to exciting new conjectures going well beyond the classical work of Sen.
