### Multivariate thinking and the introductory statistics and data science course: preparing students to make sense of a world of observational data
<p>
We live in a world of ever expanding "found" (or observational) data. To make decisions and disentangle complex relationships, students need a solid background in design and confounding. The revised Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistical Education (GAISE) College Report enunicated the importance of multivariate thinking as a way to move beyond bivariate thinking. But how do such learning outcomes compete with other aspects of statistics knowledge (e.g., inference and p-values) in introductory courses that are already overfull. In this talk I will offer some reflections and guidance about how we might move forward, with specific implications for introductory statistics and data science courses.

### Nicholas Horton
<p>
Nicholas Horton is Professor of Statistics at Amherst College, with methodologic research interests in longitudinal regression models, missing data methods, and statistical computing.  He graduated from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in 1999.  Nick has received the ASA's Founders Award, the Waller Education Award,  the William Warde Mu Sigma Rho Education Award, and the MAA Hogg Award for Excellence in Teaching.  He has published more than 160 papers, co-authored a series of four books on statistical computing and data science, and was co-PI on the NSF funded MOSAIC project.  Nick is a Fellow of the ASA and the AAAS, served as a member of the ASA Board, chairs the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies and is chaired the ASA Section on Statistical Education.  He is a member of the National Academies of Sciences Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics and two Academy studies on undergraduate data science education.

### Experiences with big data analytics in the clinic and the classroom at Harvey Mudd College

<p>
The Data Explosion is changing how professors teach undergraduate students in every area of the curriculum including courses, researches and industry projects.   In this talk I will share some experiences and challenges with big data analytics in the Clinic and the classroom at Harvey Mudd College (HMC).  The Clinic is a program of collaboration between industry and the College that engages juniors and seniors in the solution of real-world technical problems for industrial clients.  One of my jobs as mathematics clinic director at HMC is to recruit clinic projects for the HMC students.  There are big data problems in every company I visit. These companies know that machine learning tools exist to help solve their data problems, but either they are too busy dealing with large amounts of data to identify the right tools and algorithms, or they lack the modeling skills to use the tools effectively. To address these challenges I have designed a course to turn HMC students into big data consultants, familiar with standard tools and algorithms and able to apply them to real-world problems. This course presents challenges of its own, and I will discuss it as a work in progress.

### It may be deep, but is it learning?
<p>
As statistician David Moore was leaving Princeton with his newly minted PhD, his
adviser Jack Kiefer warned him: “Just remember, there’s a lot of statistics every sociologist
knows that you don’t know.” The thesis of my talk is borrowed from Kiefer’s caution. When it
comes to learning from observed data, there’s plenty that students of the Humanities know
that data science has yet to address. In my talk I plan to raise some challenges for data science
raised by learning in the Humanities.
I plan to raise these challenges in the context of a question that should concern all of us:
How can we teach data science as a subject worthy of the Liberal Arts? I rely in part on two
recent opinion pieces: “What is Statistics?” (Brown and Kass, The American Statistician 2012)
and “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” (Leo Breiman, Statistical Science 2001). My thesis
is that what most distinguishes a Liberal Arts education from vocational training is a self-
referential emphasis on learning how to learn.
